OFF-TARGET AMPLIFICATION

Insignificant off-target amplification detected. Only 3% of reads are off-target.

REFERENCE_LIST

Collapsing MiSeq cell barcodes against the platform's reference list may lead to more FPs and FNs.

FILTERING

Sequencing depth insufficent. Low number of reads detected in FASTQ.

ANALYSIS

No issues detected during analysis.

RESULTS

Low +Dox induction detected. Only 20% of CBs reported an edited CARLIN allele.

For allele(s) 62, >10% of CB halves or UMIs differ pairwise by only 1bp. This may indicate that that the cell count for these alleles is artificially inflated.
